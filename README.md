## Introduction

Grab a seat at the virtual table, it’s time to play blackjack!

The aim of this project was to improve my JavaScript proficiency through building a fun and visually-appealing online version of this classic casino game. While blackjack may seem like a relatively simple game at first glance, I thought its nuanced rules would pose an interesting challenge from a game logic perspective.

I used HTML and Tailwind CSS for the interface, and plain JavaScript for game logic and DOM manipulation. Foregoing a framework allowed me to focus on writing efficient game functions, while keeping the codebase simple and lightweight.

The biggest challenge I faced was implementing the ability to ‘split’ hands, which required substantial refactoring of the existing code. It was also my first time working with modals and CSS animations.

I hope you enjoy my efforts; may the cards be in your favour!
